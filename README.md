# IDX - Seamless Cross-Chain Index Creation Platform

IDX is a cutting-edge platform for creating and managing crypto indexes across different blockchains, leveraging advanced chain abstraction technologies for a seamless user experience.

## üí´ Protocol Overview

IDX builds on Set Protocol to enable anyone to create and manage their own crypto indexes:

- **Create**: Design your index by selecting tokens and their allocations
- **Manage**: Set streaming fees (up to 10%) that accrue to you as the manager
- **Trade**: Users can mint (issue) or redeem index tokens at their underlying value
- **Earn**: Index managers earn streaming fees from all holders

## üåü Key Features

- **User-Friendly Index Creation**: Create custom crypto indexes with multiple tokens in just a few clicks
- **Cross-Chain Capabilities**: Seamlessly interact with indexes across Base Sepolia and Arbitrum Sepolia
- **Automated Gas Management**: Smart cross-chain gas bridging from Arbitrum to Base
- **Social Login & Web3 Wallets**: Simplified onboarding through Particle Connect
- **Streaming Fees**: Built-in revenue model for index managers
- **Batch Operations**: One-click token approvals and issuance

## üîß Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Smart Account Infrastructure**: Klaster SDK for chain abstraction
- **Wallet Management**: Particle Connect for seamless authentication
- **Token Standards**: ERC20-compatible with SetToken protocol
